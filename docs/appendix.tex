\section{Appendix}

This appendix collects small implementation notes that are useful for understanding the
code but are not central to the main method descriptions.

\subsection{Coordinate system: latitude/longitude to meters}

This subsection explains the local projection used so the filters can operate in meters.

Internally, the filter runs in a local tangent-plane approximation. We choose a local
origin near the current area and convert \((\text{lat}, \text{lon})\) into \((x, y)\)
meters relative to that origin.

This is implemented with helpers in \texttt{geo.js} (\texttt{toMeters}, \texttt{fromMeters}).
Over the distances we care about at a start line, this approximation is accurate enough and
avoids complicated geodesy inside the filter.
