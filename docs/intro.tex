\section{Introduction}

RaceTimer is a minimal race-start tool for sailors. The goal is simple: stable, readable
numbers you can trust when the start line is busy.

This document is a technical report that explains how the app works and why the math is
set up the way it is. It is structured so more chapters can be added later (e.g.\ UI/UX
design notes, validation logs, or device-specific sensor behavior), without turning the
Kalman chapter into a catch-all.

The Kalman filter exists to turn jittery GPS fixes into a steady position and a stable
velocity vector:
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  numbers should not jump around when you need to make decisions quickly
\item
  direction and speed estimates should not flip wildly from one fix to the next
\item
  the filter should adapt automatically when GPS quality changes
\end{itemize}
