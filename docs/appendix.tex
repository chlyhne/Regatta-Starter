\subsection{Coordinate system: latitude/longitude to meters}

Internally, the filter runs in a local tangent-plane approximation:
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  choose a local origin near the current area
\item
  convert \((\text{lat}, \text{lon})\) into \((x, y)\) meters relative to that origin
\end{itemize}

This is implemented with helpers in \texttt{geo.js} (\texttt{toMeters}, \texttt{fromMeters}).
Over the distances we care about at a start line, this approximation is accurate enough and
avoids complicated geodesy inside the filter.
