\section{Introduction}

RaceTools is a minimal collection of race-day tools for sailors. RaceStarter is the
race-start module. The goal is simple: stable, readable
numbers you can trust when the start line is busy.

The app opens on a Home screen with two tools: RaceStarter and RaceVMG. Boat and Settings
are accessed from Home so both modes share the same configuration.

This document is a technical report that explains how the app works and why the math is
set up the way it is. It is structured by tool:
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item RaceStarter: start line setup, race view, and the estimation methods needed to make
  the numbers stable.
\item RaceVMG: VMG Hunter (upwind), which estimates the speed/heading trade-off from small
  changes while sailing.
\end{itemize}

Across both tools, the most important requirement is trust: jittery raw GPS fixes must be
turned into a steady position and stable speed/heading estimates:
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  numbers should not jump around when you need to make decisions quickly
\item
  direction and speed estimates should not flip wildly from one fix to the next
\item
  the filter should adapt automatically when GPS quality changes
\end{itemize}
